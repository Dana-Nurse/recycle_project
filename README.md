The Recycle Project is a web application designed to help users track and manage their recycling habits. 
It encourages environmentally-friendly practices by allowing users to log the types of materials they recycle, 
monitor their progress, and receive tips on how to improve their recycling efforts. The aim is to reduce waste 
and promote sustainability by making recycling a more informed and accessible process.

Features
Material Tracking: Log different types of recyclable materials such as plastic, paper, glass, and metal.
Progress Monitoring: View your recycling history and track your impact on reducing waste over time.
Environmental Tips: Receive tailored suggestions on how to improve your recycling habits and reduce your overall waste.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design to ensure that users of all ages can easily log their recycling activities.

Automated Deployment Pipeline
This project is an opportunity for me to practice DevOps principles. 
The automated deployment pipeline for the Recycle Project is set up to ensure that every update is thoroughly tested 
and seamlessly deployed to the cloud. The pipeline includes:

- Continuous Integration (CI): Automated tests are run every time new code is pushed to the repository,
  ensuring that all new features and updates are stable and free of errors.

- Continuous Deployment (CD): After passing all tests, the updates are automatically deployed to the live environment,
  making the latest features available to users immediately.

Technology Stack
- Python: Backend logic and data processing.
- Flask: Web framework for building the application.
- SQL: Database management for storing user data and recycling logs.
- HTML: Frontend for user interface.
- Docker: Containerisation of the application to ensure consistent environments across different stages of deployment.
- Microsoft Azure: Cloud hosting and deployment of the application.
